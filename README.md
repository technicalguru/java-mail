# Java Mail 

This project supports the mail creation and sending process in Java. It was
originally developed to support my Spring Boot projects. Java Mail consists of
two parts:

- [mail-templates](https://github.com/technicalguru/java-mail/tree/master/mail-templates) - generate e-mail content based on (Freemarker) templates.
- [mail-queue](https://github.com/technicalguru/java-mail/tree/master/mail-queue) - process e-mails asynchronically


## Latest Version

Latest version is 1.1.1. (Jakarta API). For javax.main.* API please use 1.0.2.
